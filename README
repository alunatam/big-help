== Welcome to BIG Help

Welcome to BIG Help. BIG Help is an open-source help ticket system that can be used by consumer-focused web companies.

== Roadmap

Done:
- Ticket model
- Help controller
- Tickets can be submitted

Coming up: 
- Email notification to customer
- Adding support users & authentication
- Email notifications to support users
- Admin controller for support users (to browse tickets)
- Ability to add messages to tickets
- Mobile version(?)

== Setup

1. Create your database

2. Edit the config/database.yml file

3. Edit the config/config.yml file (see below)

4. Run migration(s) with rake db:migrate

5. Edit the view in app/views/help/index.html.erb (see below)

6. Fire up your mongrel(s) or mod_rails

== The config.yml file

The config.yml file contains settings about your app and company. You should edit this file with your information. When BIG Help starts, these values are loaded into the AppConfig hash and used in the layouts, views, and email methods. 

== Custom field

The Ticket model contains a property called "custom", allowing some flexibility in your help form. The label for your custom field is defined in the config.yml file. You'll probably want to use it for something like "Order number" or "User ID".

== The home page

The root of the app is routed to /help/index, which renders the /app/views/help/index.html.erb file. This is designed to be a general entry point for your customers. Personally, I like to present customers with FAQs or a Wiki before letting them submit a ticket. If that's not your style, you can change map.root to route to help/new (in config/routes.rb).

== Ticket key

When a customer submits a support ticket, they are presented with a unique 8-character "key" or "token". The key can be used to look up their ticket later. If you'd like the change the length, you'll find it defined in the Ticket model file (app/models/ticket.rb).
